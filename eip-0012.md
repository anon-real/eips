# Autolykos 2

Autolykos is Proof-of-Work scheme used in Ergo. It was intended to be memory-hard and pool-restistant. 
However, it was found that memory-hardness of the scheme can be bypassed.

This document describes Autolykos v. 2, which is improving memory-hardness of the original design.


# Changes

Original Autolykos scheme is decribed at [https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf).
Proving and verification functions are defined in the Algorithms 1 and 2 of the paper.

The proposed changes are:

Alg. 2, line 4: m || nonce  => pk || w || m || nonce
Alg. 2, line 5: H(j|M|pk|m|w) => H(j|pk|w|M|m)

And lines 3 and 6 in the Alg. 1 to be changed correspondingly.


# Implementation

Reference implementation can be find at [https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1141](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/pull/1141)
